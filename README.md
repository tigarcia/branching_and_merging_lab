# Branching and Merging Lab


An exercise to exemplify branching and merging

## Instructions

* Form teams of 2 people
* Have __just 1__ of the team members fork and clone this repo.
* Give write access to team member 2 to the forked repo.
* Have team member 2 also clone the repo.
* There are 2 functions in the ```problemSet.js``` file.  Each team member should make a separate feature branch and complete 1 function.  Commit those changes, then merge your changes back to master.
    * Be sure to resolve any errors when merging to master.
    * Make sure you push your feature branch up to the repo so the world can see it
    * The goal here is to get better at branching and merging so work together on the problems and if you get stuck, go with what you've got so far.
    * Treat this like a real world project.  Merge issues in master is a __big__ problem!
